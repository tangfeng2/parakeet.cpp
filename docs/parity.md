# parakeet.cpp — Parity report

This document records the numerical and end-to-end parity of the C++/ggml
inference path against the NeMo reference implementation.

**Anchor checkpoint:** `nvidia/parakeet-tdt_ctc-110m` — the **CTC head** of the
hybrid TDT/CTC model (selected via `m.change_decoding_strategy(decoder_type='ctc')`).
NeMo version 2.7.3. All comparisons are CPU, batch size 1, deterministic
(CTC greedy decode).

---

## Model coverage matrix (Phase 3.5 — all offline Parakeet checkpoints)

Every published offline Parakeet checkpoint validated end-to-end against NeMo on
`tests/fixtures/speech.wav` (LibriSpeech `2086-149220-0033`, ~7.4 s, English).
`WER vs NeMo` is word-error-rate (0.0 = byte-for-byte identical). All runs are
CPU, batch 1, deterministic greedy (NeMo 2.7.3).

| Checkpoint | Family | arch | d\_model / layers | mel | xscaling | vocab | Validated head(s) | WER vs NeMo | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `parakeet-tdt_ctc-110m` | Hybrid TDT+CTC | `hybrid_tdt_ctc` | 512 / 17 | 80 | false | 1024 | TDT + CTC | **0.0** | PASS |
| `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2` | TDT (hybrid) | `hybrid_tdt_ctc` | 1024 / 24 | 128 | false | 1024 | TDT | **0.0** | PASS |
| `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3` | TDT (hybrid, multilingual) | `hybrid_tdt_ctc` | 1024 / 24 | 128 | false | 8192 | TDT | **0.0** | PASS |
| `parakeet-tdt-0.6b` (v1) | TDT | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | N/A — not published (superseded by v2) |
| `parakeet-tdt-1.1b` | TDT | `tdt` | 1024 / 42 | 80 | false | 1024 | TDT | **0.0** | PASS |
| `parakeet-tdt_ctc-1.1b` | Hybrid TDT+CTC | `hybrid_tdt_ctc` | 1024 / 42 | 80 | false | 1024 | TDT + CTC | **0.0** | PASS |
| `parakeet-ctc-0.6b` | CTC | `ctc` | 1024 / 24 | 80 | **true** | 1024 | CTC | **0.0** | PASS |
| `parakeet-ctc-1.1b` | CTC | `ctc` | 1024 / 42 | 80 | **true** | 1024 | CTC | **0.0** | PASS |
| `parakeet-rnnt-0.6b` | RNNT | `rnnt` | 1024 / 24 | 80 | **true** | 1024 | RNNT | **0.0** | PASS |
| `parakeet-rnnt-1.1b` | RNNT | `rnnt` | 1024 / 42 | 80 | **true** | 1024 | RNNT | **0.0** | PASS |
| `parakeet_realtime_eou_120m-v1` | Streaming + EOU | `rnnt` | 512 / 17 | 128 | false | 1026 | RNNT (offline, limited-context) | **0.0** | PASS (Phase 5 — 5a milestone) |

Notes:
- `xscaling` = NeMo FastConformer `xscale=sqrt(d_model)` (true) vs `xscale=None` (false).
- Hybrid models validated on both TDT and CTC heads where practical.
- `parakeet-tdt-1.1b` is labelled `tdt` (pure, no `aux_ctc`); the two 0.6B TDT
  checkpoints are labelled `hybrid_tdt_ctc` (NeMo stores them as
  `EncDecRNNTBPEModel` with `cfg.aux_ctc`).
- Committed regression tests lock the CTC and RNNT decoder paths against
  regression: `tests/test_transcribe_ctc.cpp` (`PARAKEET_TEST_GGUF_CTC`) and
  `tests/test_transcribe_rnnt.cpp` (`PARAKEET_TEST_GGUF_RNNT`) — both skip (exit
  77) in CI unless the corresponding GGUF env var is set.
- `parakeet_realtime_eou_120m-v1` offline (5a): vocab 1026 includes `<EOU>`=1024
  and `<EOB>`=1025; blank_id=1026 (V_plus=1027); the transducer emits `<EOU>`
  literally at end-of-utterance — the C++ offline transcript matches NeMo including
  the trailing `<EOU>` token.
- `parakeet_realtime_eou_120m-v1` cache-aware streaming (5b/5c, Tasks 5-7): the
  streaming encoder output == offline (leading frames, max|d|≈3e-6) and ==
  NeMo's `cache_aware_stream_step` output; streaming decode tokens == NeMo
  cache-aware streaming == offline minus the trailing streaming-tail `<EOU>`.
  EOU/EOB are surfaced as timed events (stripped from the running text). For this
  clip NeMo's streaming does NOT emit `<EOU>` (the final-chunk tail has incomplete
  right context); the C++ streaming session/C-API/CLI match that exactly and do
  not fabricate one. See "Phase 5 — Streaming + EOU" below.

## Real-speech end-to-end check (Task 12)

The decisive proof: a real English utterance transcribed by the full C++
pipeline (mel → subsampling → FastConformer encoder → CTC head → CTC greedy
decode → BPE detokenize) compared word-for-word against NeMo's CTC-head
transcript of the same clip.

**Fixture:** `tests/fixtures/speech.wav` — LibriSpeech dev-clean sample
`2086-149220-0033`, 16 kHz mono, 16-bit PCM, ~7.4 s. Obtained from the public
NeMo tutorial mirror
`https://dldata-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/2086-149220-0033.wav`
(already 16 kHz mono; re-encoded to canonical 16-bit PCM via soundfile).

This clip is substantially harder than the synthetic-tone clip used for the
per-stage tensor-parity tests: it is ~3.7x longer and contains real speech, so
it exercises per-feature normalization and valid-length masking at a different
sequence length `T`, and a non-trivial greedy collapse over a real token stream
— exactly the length-dependent code paths a single fixed-length tone clip could
not have validated.

| Source | Transcript |
| --- | --- |
| **NeMo CTC reference** | `Well, I don't wish to see it any more, observed Phoebe, turning away her eyes. It is certainly very like the old portrait.` |
| **C++ `parakeet-cli transcribe`** | `Well, I don't wish to see it any more, observed Phoebe, turning away her eyes. It is certainly very like the old portrait.` |

**Result:** byte-for-byte identical. **WER = 0.0** (0 edits over 23 reference
words).

Reproduce:

```bash
# NeMo CTC reference
.venv/bin/python -c "from nemo.collections.asr.models import ASRModel; \
m=ASRModel.from_pretrained('nvidia/parakeet-tdt_ctc-110m'); \
m.change_decoding_strategy(decoder_type='ctc'); \
print(m.transcribe(['tests/fixtures/speech.wav'])[0].text)"

# C++ pipeline
./build/examples/cli/parakeet-cli transcribe --model /tmp/pk110m.gguf \
    --input tests/fixtures/speech.wav
```

A committed regression test asserts this match deterministically:
`tests/test_transcribe_speech.cpp` (ctest `test_transcribe_speech`, label
`model`). It runs `pk::transcribe` on the committed `speech.wav` and asserts the
output equals the stored NeMo CTC reference string.

---

## Per-stage tensor parity (synthetic-tone clip)

Each stage diffs its C++ output against the matching tensor dumped from NeMo by
`scripts/gen_nemo_baseline.py` (stored in `baseline.gguf`). Numbers below are
the measured `max|diff|` from the ctest suite on `tests/fixtures/clip.wav`.

| Stage | ctest | max\|diff\| | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Log-mel front end | `test_mel` | **4.13e-05** | `mel` `[80, T]` |
| dw_striding subsampling (÷8) | `test_subsampling` | **6.35e-03** | `subsampling_out`; largest-magnitude stage |
| Relative-position MHA (layer 0) | `test_relpos_attention` | **1.71e-03** | `l0_attn_out` |
| Conformer conv submodule | `test_conformer` | **1.58e-03** | `l0_conv_out` |
| Conformer layer 0 (full) | `test_conformer` | **5.34e-05** | `enc_layer_0` |
| Relative positional encoding | `test_encoder` | **1.55e-06** | `pos_emb` `[2T'-1, d_model]` |
| Encoder (full, last layer) | `test_encoder` | **2.40e-05** | `encoder_out` `[d_model, T']` |
| CTC head (log-softmax logits) | `test_ctc` | **1.72e-05** | `ctc_logits` `[T', vocab+1]` |

Notes:
- Diffs are absolute. The subsampling stage carries the largest absolute diff
  (6.3e-3) because its outputs have large magnitudes (O(1e3)); the relative
  error there is ~1e-6. Downstream stages (encoder, CTC) re-normalize and the
  absolute diff collapses back to O(1e-5).
- The CTC `exp`-row-sums equal 1.0 (the baseline stores post-`log_softmax`
  logits, and the C++ head matches that orientation).
- All stage diffs are well within the plan's tolerances and the greedy argmax /
  collapse is unaffected, which is why the end-to-end transcript is exact.

## Phase 2 — transducer core parity (max abs diff vs NeMo)

| Component | max\|diff\| | tolerance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| prediction net (embedding + 1-layer LSTM) | 1.5e-06 | 2e-3 |
| joint network (enc/pred proj → ReLU → linear, raw logits) | 1.1e-05 | 5e-3 |
| composed pred→joint (integration) | 1.3e-05 | 5e-3 |

- The joint emits **raw** logits `[T, U, 1030]` = 1024 vocab + 1 blank + 5 TDT
  durations `[0,1,2,3,4]`; the token/duration split + separate log_softmax is a
  Phase 3 (greedy) concern.
- The prediction net prepends a literal zero SOS step (`add_sos`), so 4 input
  ids → 5 hidden states. PyTorch LSTM gate order `[i,f,g,o]`, both biases summed.

## Phase 3 — North-star validation (TDT end-to-end vs NeMo)

The decisive Phase 3 deliverable: the real Parakeet-TDT models people use,
transcribed by the full C++ TDT path (mel → FastConformer encoder → prediction
net + joint → duration-aware greedy decode → BPE detokenize) and compared
word-for-word against NeMo's TDT-head transcript of the same clip. All on
`tests/fixtures/speech.wav` (LibriSpeech `2086-149220-0033`, English, ~7.4 s).
NeMo 2.7.3, CPU, batch 1, deterministic greedy.

### Model `info` (config read from the GGUF metadata)

| Model | arch | d_model / layers / heads | mels | conv norm | xscaling | durations | vocab | pred LSTM layers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `parakeet-tdt_ctc-110m` (TDT head) | `hybrid_tdt_ctc` | 512 / 17 / 8 | 80 | batch_norm | false | `[0,1,2,3,4]` | 1024 | 1 |
| `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2` | `hybrid_tdt_ctc` | 1024 / 24 / 8 | 128 | batch_norm | false | `[0,1,2,3,4]` | 1024 | 2 |
| `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3` | `hybrid_tdt_ctc` | 1024 / 24 / 8 | 128 | batch_norm | false | `[0,1,2,3,4]` | 8192 | 2 |

(`xscaling` is **false** on all three — NeMo's FastConformer `xscale=None`. The
0.6B checkpoints load in NeMo as `EncDecRNNTBPEModel`; the converter labels them
`hybrid_tdt_ctc` because `cfg.aux_ctc` is present, and the C++ default routes to
the TDT head either way, matching NeMo's default transducer transcription.)

### NeMo vs C++ transcripts + WER

| Model | NeMo (TDT) | C++ `parakeet-cli transcribe --decoder tdt` | WER |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `parakeet-tdt_ctc-110m` | `Well, I don't wish to see it any more, observed Phoebe, turning away her eyes. It is certainly very like the old portrait.` | `Well, I don't wish to see it any more, observed Phoebe, turning away her eyes. It is certainly very like the old portrait.` | **0.0** |
| `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2` | `Well, I don't wish to see it any more, observed Phebe, turning away her eyes. It is certainly very like the old portrait.` | `Well, I don't wish to see it any more, observed Phebe, turning away her eyes. It is certainly very like the old portrait.` | **0.0** |
| `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3` | `Well, I don't wish to see it any more, observed Phoebe, turning away her eyes. It is certainly very like the old portrait.` | `Well, I don't wish to see it any more, observed Phoebe, turning away her eyes. It is certainly very like the old portrait.` | **0.0** |

All three are **byte-for-byte identical** to NeMo (0 edits over 23 reference
words). The only inter-model difference is the BPE spelling `Phebe` (v2 1024-token
vocab) vs `Phoebe` (v3 8192-token vocab) — both faithfully reproduce their own
tokenizer, exactly as NeMo does. This is the Phase 3 headline: the production
`parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2` and multilingual `-v3` transcribe real speech identically
to NeMo through the C++/ggml port.

Reproduce:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/convert_parakeet_to_gguf.py \
    --model nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2 --output /tmp/tdt06v2.gguf
./build/examples/cli/parakeet-cli info /tmp/tdt06v2.gguf
./build/examples/cli/parakeet-cli transcribe \
    --model /tmp/tdt06v2.gguf --input tests/fixtures/speech.wav --decoder tdt
# NeMo reference (TDT is the default head for this model):
.venv/bin/python -c "from nemo.collections.asr.models import ASRModel; \
m=ASRModel.from_pretrained('nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2'); \
print(m.transcribe(['tests/fixtures/speech.wav'])[0].text)"
```

### Code changes the 0.6B models required (metadata-honoring, not special-cased)

The 110m anchor (xscaling=False, 1-layer LSTM, conv/linear biases present) had
matched NeMo, so two latent assumptions surfaced only on the larger checkpoints.
The encoder output was already byte-exact on 0.6B-v2 (`enc_out` mean 1.80e-06,
std 0.0763, range ±0.69 — identical to NeMo); the divergences were:

1. **Optional Conv1d / Linear biases.** NeMo configures the FastConformer FFN
   and attention `nn.Linear`s and the conv submodule's `Conv1d`s with
   `bias=False` on `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2/-v3` (they are `bias=True` on the
   110m). The C++ conformer/attention unconditionally fetched the `.bias`
   tensors → null-deref / segfault. Fix: `src/conformer.cpp` and
   `src/relpos_attention.cpp` now add the bias only when the tensor is actually
   present in the checkpoint (`clone_weight_opt` / `ml.tensor(...)` guard).

2. **Stacked prediction LSTM.** `parakeet.decoder.pred_rnn_layers = 2` on the
   0.6B models (vs 1 on the 110m). The C++ `PredictionNet` ran only LSTM layer
   `_l0`, ignoring `_l1`, producing a wrong prediction-net output and a garbage
   transcript. Fix: `src/prediction.{hpp,cpp}` now read `pred_rnn_layers` from
   the GGUF and run a true stacked LSTM (`PredState` carries per-layer `(h,c)`;
   layer `l>0` consumes layer `l-1`'s hidden output), defaulting to 1 layer.

Both fixes honor the GGUF metadata / actual tensors; no model is special-cased.
Per-stage tensor parity (above) and the 110m end-to-end TDT/CTC transcripts are
unchanged (all earlier ctests still pass).

## Phase 3.5 — Standalone CTC coverage (xscaling=True, vs NeMo)

The standalone `EncDecCTCModelBPE` checkpoints (`parakeet-ctc-*`) are the first
end-to-end validation of two paths that no prior checkpoint exercised:

1. **Standalone CTC head name.** A hybrid model stores the CTC linear head at
   `ctc_decoder.decoder_layers.0.{weight,bias}`; a standalone CTC model stores
   the SAME layer at `decoder.decoder_layers.0.{weight,bias}`. `pk::CTCDecoder`
   now tries the hybrid name first and falls back to the standalone name (clear
   error only if neither exists) — `src/ctc_decoder.cpp`, no model special-cased.
2. **Encoder xscaling=True.** Every previously validated checkpoint had
   `xscaling=False`; `parakeet-ctc-0.6b`/`-1.1b` set NeMo's FastConformer
   `xscale=sqrt(d_model)`. This is the first real exercise of the C++ encoder's
   `*sqrt(d_model)` branch (`pk::Encoder`, gated on `cfg.xscaling`). It worked
   **out of the box** — no fix was needed; both transcripts matched NeMo exactly.

### Model `info` (config read from the GGUF metadata)

| Model | arch | d_model / layers / heads | mels | conv norm | xscaling | vocab | CTC head tensor |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `parakeet-ctc-0.6b` | `ctc` | 1024 / 24 / 8 | 80 | batch_norm | **true** | 1024 | `decoder.decoder_layers.0.*` |
| `parakeet-ctc-1.1b` | `ctc` | 1024 / 42 / 8 | 80 | batch_norm | **true** | 1024 | `decoder.decoder_layers.0.*` |

### NeMo vs C++ transcripts + WER (`tests/fixtures/speech.wav`)

| Model | NeMo (CTC) | C++ `parakeet-cli transcribe --decoder ctc` | WER |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `parakeet-ctc-0.6b` | `well i don't wish to see it any more observed phoebe turning away her eyes it is certainly very like the old portrait` | `well i don't wish to see it any more observed phoebe turning away her eyes it is certainly very like the old portrait` | **0.0** |
| `parakeet-ctc-1.1b` | `well i don't wish to see it any more observed phoebe turning away her eyes it is certainly very like the old portrait` | `well i don't wish to see it any more observed phoebe turning away her eyes it is certainly very like the old portrait` | **0.0** |

Both are **byte-for-byte identical** to NeMo (0 edits over 23 reference words).
These standalone CTC models emit lowercase, unpunctuated text (their own
tokenizer/training), distinct from the cased/punctuated hybrid + TDT models — and
the C++ port faithfully reproduces each model's own output. Validated with the
reusable harness `scripts/validate_vs_nemo.py`:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/convert_parakeet_to_gguf.py \
    --model nvidia/parakeet-ctc-0.6b --output /tmp/val_ctc06.gguf
./build/examples/cli/parakeet-cli info /tmp/val_ctc06.gguf   # arch=ctc, xscaling=true
.venv/bin/python scripts/validate_vs_nemo.py \
    --model nvidia/parakeet-ctc-0.6b --gguf /tmp/val_ctc06.gguf \
    --audio tests/fixtures/speech.wav --head ctc
# -> MODEL nvidia/parakeet-ctc-0.6b HEAD ctc arch=ctc xscaling=true WER 0.0000 ... PASS
```

The harness loads the NeMo model, auto-selects the head (CTC model→ctc,
RNNT/TDT→rnnt, hybrid→transducer), gets the NeMo reference via `m.transcribe`,
shells out to `parakeet-cli transcribe` (head ctc→`--decoder ctc`,
rnnt/tdt→`--decoder tdt`), computes word-level WER, and exits 0 on PASS / 1 on
WER>0 / 77 if NeMo can't be imported.

## Phase 3.5 — Standard RNNT coverage (vs NeMo)

The pure-RNNT `EncDecRNNTBPEModel` checkpoints (`parakeet-rnnt-*`) are the first
end-to-end validation of the **standard RNN-Transducer greedy loop** — a path no
prior checkpoint exercised. Every transducer validated in Phase 3 was a TDT model
(its joint emits `vocab+1+num_durations` and decoding is duration-aware). A pure
RNNT model has **no duration head**: its joint output is exactly `vocab+1`
(`Joint::num_durations()==0`, `V_plus=vocab+1`), and greedy decoding advances time
by exactly one frame on a blank and emits-and-stays on a non-blank (capped by
`max_symbols`).

1. **`pk::rnnt_greedy`** (`src/rnnt.hpp` / `src/rnnt.cpp`) ports NeMo
   `GreedyRNNTInfer._greedy_decode`. Versus `pk::tdt_greedy`: no duration logits
   (argmax over the full `vocab+1` joint output); blank → advance `t` by 1;
   non-blank → emit + commit state + stay at `t` (capped by `max_symbols=10`).
2. **Routing** (`src/parakeet.cpp`): when the transducer head is selected, the
   loader's `cfg.tdt_durations` now decides the loop — non-empty → `tdt_greedy`
   (unchanged); empty → `rnnt_greedy`. This makes `arch ∈ {rnnt, hybrid_rnnt_ctc}`
   (and any TDT-less transducer) work; it replaces the old guard that fell back to
   CTC when no durations were configured (which a pure-RNNT model lacks). TDT and
   CTC paths are unchanged. Both `parakeet-rnnt-*` models also set `xscaling=true`.

### Model `info` (config read from the GGUF metadata)

| Model | arch | d_model / layers / heads | mels | conv norm | xscaling | durations | vocab |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `parakeet-rnnt-0.6b` | `rnnt` | 1024 / 24 / 8 | 80 | batch_norm | **true** | none | 1024 |
| `parakeet-rnnt-1.1b` | `rnnt` | 1024 / 42 / 8 | 80 | batch_norm | **true** | none | 1024 |

### NeMo vs C++ transcripts + WER (`tests/fixtures/speech.wav`)

| Model | NeMo (RNNT) | C++ `parakeet-cli transcribe --decoder tdt` | WER |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `parakeet-rnnt-0.6b` | `well i don't wish to see it any more observed phoebe turning away her eyes it is certainly very like the old portrait` | `well i don't wish to see it any more observed phoebe turning away her eyes it is certainly very like the old portrait` | **0.0** |
| `parakeet-rnnt-1.1b` | `well i don't wish to see it any more observed phoebe turning away her eyes it is certainly very like the old portrait` | `well i don't wish to see it any more observed phoebe turning away her eyes it is certainly very like the old portrait` | **0.0** |

Both are **byte-for-byte identical** to NeMo (0 edits over 23 reference words) —
the `rnnt_greedy` loop matched on the first run with no divergence debugging
needed. The CLI `--decoder tdt` selects the transducer head and now routes to
`rnnt_greedy` because the duration table is empty. Validated with the harness:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/convert_parakeet_to_gguf.py \
    --model nvidia/parakeet-rnnt-0.6b --output /tmp/val_rnnt06.gguf
./build/examples/cli/parakeet-cli info /tmp/val_rnnt06.gguf   # arch=rnnt, xscaling=true
.venv/bin/python scripts/validate_vs_nemo.py \
    --model nvidia/parakeet-rnnt-0.6b --gguf /tmp/val_rnnt06.gguf \
    --audio tests/fixtures/speech.wav --head rnnt
# -> MODEL nvidia/parakeet-rnnt-0.6b HEAD rnnt arch=rnnt xscaling=true WER 0.0000 ... PASS
```

## Phase 3.5 — Remaining TDT / hybrid checkpoints (vs NeMo)

The remaining published TDT and hybrid-TDT/CTC checkpoints, validated end-to-end
with `scripts/validate_vs_nemo.py` on `tests/fixtures/speech.wav` (NeMo 2.7.3,
CPU, batch 1, deterministic greedy). **No code change was required** — every one
loaded purely from GGUF metadata (the loader already handles 80/128 mel,
1024/8192 vocab, 1/2 LSTM layers, 24/42 layers, xscaling true/false, optional
biases). The 1.1B TDT model is the first checkpoint NeMo restores as a *pure*
`EncDecRNNTBPEModel` whose converter label is `tdt` (it has no `aux_ctc`), so it
also exercises the standalone-`tdt`-arch routing — distinct from the `-0.6b-v2/-v3`
hybrids that NeMo restores as RNNT but the converter labels `hybrid_tdt_ctc`.

### Model `info` (config read from the GGUF metadata)

| Model | HF id | arch | d_model / layers / heads | mels | conv norm | xscaling | durations | vocab |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| parakeet-tdt-0.6b (v1) | `nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b` | — | **N/A — not published** | — | — | — | — | — |
| parakeet-tdt-1.1b | `nvidia/parakeet-tdt-1.1b` | `tdt` | 1024 / 42 / 8 | 80 | batch_norm | false | `[0,1,2,3,4]` | 1024 |
| parakeet-tdt_ctc-1.1b | `nvidia/parakeet-tdt_ctc-1.1b` | `hybrid_tdt_ctc` | 1024 / 42 / 8 | 80 | batch_norm | false | `[0,1,2,3,4]` | 1024 |

The v1 `nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b` is **not published** under that id (HF API 401 /
converter 404; the only public `nvidia` `parakeet-tdt` repos are `-0.6b-v2`,
`-0.6b-v3`, `-1.1b`, the `parakeet-tdt_ctc-*` hybrids, and `-tdt_ctc-0.6b-ja`).
It was superseded by `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2`, already validated at WER 0 in Phase 3.

### NeMo vs C++ transcripts + WER (`tests/fixtures/speech.wav`)

| Model | head | NeMo | C++ | WER |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `parakeet-tdt-1.1b` | TDT (`--decoder tdt`) | `well i don't wish to see it any more observed phoebe turning away her eyes it is certainly very like the old portrait` | `well i don't wish to see it any more observed phoebe turning away her eyes it is certainly very like the old portrait` | **0.0** |
| `parakeet-tdt_ctc-1.1b` | TDT (`--decoder tdt`) | `Well, I don't wish to see it any more, observed Phoebe, turning away her eyes. It is certainly very like the old portrait.` | `Well, I don't wish to see it any more, observed Phoebe, turning away her eyes. It is certainly very like the old portrait.` | **0.0** |
| `parakeet-tdt_ctc-1.1b` | CTC (`--decoder ctc`) | `Well, I don't wish to see it any more, observed Phoebe, turning away her eyes. It is certainly very like the old portrait.` | `Well, I don't wish to see it any more, observed Phoebe, turning away her eyes. It is certainly very like the old portrait.` | **0.0** |

All are **byte-for-byte identical** to NeMo (0 edits over 23 reference words). The
pure-TDT `parakeet-tdt-1.1b` emits lowercase/unpunctuated text (its own training);
the hybrid `parakeet-tdt_ctc-1.1b` emits cased/punctuated text on *both* of its
heads — and the C++ port reproduces each head exactly, including the second head
(CTC) of the hybrid via `--decoder ctc`. Reproduce:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/convert_parakeet_to_gguf.py \
    --model nvidia/parakeet-tdt_ctc-1.1b --output /tmp/val_tdtctc11.gguf
./build/examples/cli/parakeet-cli info /tmp/val_tdtctc11.gguf   # arch=hybrid_tdt_ctc
.venv/bin/python scripts/validate_vs_nemo.py \
    --model nvidia/parakeet-tdt_ctc-1.1b --gguf /tmp/val_tdtctc11.gguf \
    --audio tests/fixtures/speech.wav --head rnnt   # TDT head; --head ctc for the CTC head
# -> MODEL nvidia/parakeet-tdt_ctc-1.1b HEAD rnnt arch=hybrid_tdt_ctc xscaling=false WER 0.0000 ... PASS
```

## Test suite status

`ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure` (with `PARAKEET_TEST_GGUF`,
`PARAKEET_TEST_BASELINE`, `PARAKEET_TEST_BASELINE_SPEECH` exported): all runnable
tests pass. The full suite includes the 15 Phase 0/1 tests, `test_prediction`,
`test_joint`, `test_transducer_core`, `test_prediction_step`, `test_tdt_greedy`,
`test_transcribe_tdt`, plus three large-model regression tests that skip (exit 77)
when the corresponding GGUF env var is absent:

| Test | Env var | Decoder path locked |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `test_transcribe_0_6b` | `PARAKEET_TEST_GGUF_06B` | TDT greedy (`parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2/-v3`) |
| `test_transcribe_ctc` | `PARAKEET_TEST_GGUF_CTC` | Standalone CTC head (`parakeet-ctc-0.6b`) |
| `test_transcribe_rnnt` | `PARAKEET_TEST_GGUF_RNNT` | RNNT greedy (`parakeet-rnnt-0.6b`) |

Each asserts the C++ transcript equals the stored NeMo reference word-for-word
(WER 0) on `tests/fixtures/speech.wav`. All three carry the `model` label and run
from the project root (WORKING_DIRECTORY).

## Phase 5 — Streaming EOU model offline (5a milestone)

**Model:** `nvidia/parakeet_realtime_eou_120m-v1` — cache-aware streaming
FastConformer + RNNT (pure RNNT, no TDT duration table).

**Offline (limited-context) validated:** the full pipeline — mel → encoder with
`conv_norm_type=layer_norm`, causal depthwise conv, causal subsampling, and
chunked-limited attention mask (`att_context_size=[70,1]`,
`att_context_style=chunked_limited`) — matches NeMo's offline transcript on
`tests/fixtures/speech.wav` at **WER 0** (byte-for-byte identical), including
the exact token-id sequence (45 tokens, last = 1024 = `<EOU>`).

### Model config

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| arch | `rnnt` |
| d_model / layers / heads | 512 / 17 / 8 |
| mel | 128 |
| conv_norm_type | `layer_norm` |
| conv_causal | `true` |
| causal_downsampling | `true` |
| att_context_size | `[70, 1]` |
| att_context_style | `chunked_limited` |
| xscaling | `false` |
| vocab_size | 1026 (`<EOU>`=1024, `<EOB>`=1025) |
| blank_id | 1026 (V_plus = 1027) |
| tdt_durations | none (pure RNNT → rnnt_greedy) |

### NeMo vs C++ transcripts + WER (`tests/fixtures/speech.wav`)

| Mode | NeMo (offline RNNT) | C++ `parakeet-cli transcribe --decoder tdt` | WER |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Offline (limited-context) | `well i don't wish to see it any more observed phoebe turning away her eyes it is certainly very like the old portrait<EOU>` | `well i don't wish to see it any more observed phoebe turning away her eyes it is certainly very like the old portrait<EOU>` | **0.0** |

The C++ transcript is **byte-for-byte identical** to NeMo, including the literal
`<EOU>` token at the end (token id 1024 emitted by the RNNT transducer). The
token-id sequence (45 tokens) is also identical to the NeMo reference stored in
`/tmp/baseline_eou.gguf` (`rnnt_token_ids` tensor).

Note: for this offline 5a milestone, `<EOU>` appears literally in the detokenized
text — it is rendered by the BPE detokenizer as the piece string `"<EOU>"`.
EOU-as-a-separate-event (stripping it from text + exposing a timed EOU signal) is
planned for Task 7 (Part 5c).

### Regression test

`tests/test_transcribe_eou.cpp` (`test_transcribe_eou`, label `model`,
`WORKING_DIRECTORY`) — skips (exit 77) unless both `PARAKEET_TEST_GGUF_EOU` and
`PARAKEET_TEST_BASELINE_EOU` are set. Asserts:
1. `pk::transcribe(eou.gguf, speech.wav, kTDT)` equals `baseline.rnnt_text` (incl. `<EOU>`).
2. The raw RNNT token-id sequence equals the `rnnt_token_ids` int32 tensor from the baseline.

Reproduce:

```bash
# Convert (if not already done)
.venv/bin/python scripts/convert_parakeet_to_gguf.py \
    --model nvidia/parakeet_realtime_eou_120m-v1 --output /tmp/eou.gguf

# CLI
./build/examples/cli/parakeet-cli transcribe \
    --model /tmp/eou.gguf --input tests/fixtures/speech.wav --decoder tdt
# -> well i don't wish to see it any more observed phoebe ... portrait<EOU>

# ctest
PARAKEET_TEST_GGUF_EOU=/tmp/eou.gguf \
PARAKEET_TEST_BASELINE_EOU=/tmp/baseline_eou.gguf \
ctest --test-dir build -R test_transcribe_eou --output-on-failure
```

---

## Phase 5 — Streaming + EOU (5b/5c, Tasks 5-7)

**Model:** `nvidia/parakeet_realtime_eou_120m-v1` — cache-aware streaming
FastConformer RNN-T. Streaming parameters (from the GGUF `parakeet.streaming.*`
KV): `chunk_size=[9,16]`, `pre_encode_cache_size=[0,9]`, `valid_out_len=2`,
`last_channel_cache_size=70`, `drop_extra_pre_encoded=2`, `att_context=[70,1]`,
`att_context_style=chunked_limited`.

### Streaming encoder (Task 5)

`pk::StreamingEncoder` carries per-layer convolution (`cache_last_time`) and
attention (`cache_last_channel`) caches across chunks. The concatenated per-chunk
valid output equals the OFFLINE encoder output over the leading frames
(cache-aware equivalence, max|d| ≈ **2.9e-6** over the leading 92 of 94 frames),
and matches NeMo's `cache_aware_stream_step` output. The trailing
`valid_out_len=2` frames of the final chunk are the streaming tail (incomplete
right context — diverge from offline by design).

### Streaming decode + carried RNN-T state (Task 6)

`pk::StreamingSession` drives the streaming encoder + a carried RNN-T greedy
decoder state (`RnntDecodeState`: prediction-net LSTM h/c, last emitted token,
SOS flag — never reset between chunks; mirrors NeMo `partial_hypotheses`). For
`speech.wav` it emits **44 tokens**, EXACTLY equal to NeMo's own cache-aware
streaming decode (`conformer_stream_step` carrying `previous_hypotheses`) and to
the offline `rnnt_token_ids` (45) minus the trailing streaming-tail `<EOU>`=1024.

### EOU events + streaming text (Task 7)

`<EOU>`=1024 / `<EOB>`=1025 are resolved from the tokenizer pieces, STRIPPED from
the running transcript, and surfaced as timed events
(`pk::EouEvent{token, is_eob, encoder_frame, time_sec}`,
`time_sec = encoder_frame * hop * subsampling_factor / sample_rate`).

| Mode | NeMo streaming transcript | C++ streaming (`StreamingSession` / C-API / `--stream`) | `<EOU>` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cache-aware streaming (`speech.wav`) | `well i don't wish to see it any more observed phoebe turning away her eyes it is certainly very like the old portrait` | identical (byte-for-byte) | not emitted in-stream (matches NeMo `eou_in_stream=0`) |

The streaming transcript is the offline transcript with the trailing `<EOU>`
dropped — NeMo's cache-aware streaming does NOT emit it because the final-chunk
tail has incomplete right context. `finalize()` flushes the tail but does **not**
fabricate an `<EOU>` NeMo would not emit; for clips where an utterance ends with
full right context, the corresponding `<EOU>`/`<EOB>` would surface as an event.

### Streaming C-API

```c
parakeet_stream* parakeet_capi_stream_begin(parakeet_ctx*);
char* parakeet_capi_stream_feed(parakeet_stream*, const float* pcm, int n, int* eou_out);
char* parakeet_capi_stream_finalize(parakeet_stream*);
void  parakeet_capi_stream_free(parakeet_stream*);
```

`feed` accepts 16 kHz mono f32 PCM, buffers it, decodes encoder chunks as audio
arrives (carried caches), and returns the newly-finalized text (malloc'd; "" if
none); `*eou_out=1` if an `<EOU>`/`<EOB>` event fired this feed. `finalize`
flushes the tail. Strings are freed with `parakeet_capi_free_string`. Exported
from `libparakeet.so` (verified via `nm -D`).

### Regression tests

- `tests/test_streaming_encoder.cpp` (`test_streaming_encoder`) — streaming
  encoder == offline + NeMo streaming (`PARAKEET_TEST_GGUF_EOU` +
  `PARAKEET_TEST_BASELINE_EOU` + `PARAKEET_TEST_BASELINE_EOU_STREAM`).
- `tests/test_streaming_decode.cpp` (`test_streaming_decode`) — streaming tokens
  == NeMo streaming == offline minus trailing `<EOU>`.
- `tests/test_capi_stream.cpp` (`test_capi_stream`) — feeds `speech.wav` PCM in
  chunks through the streaming C-API; the concatenated text + `finalize` equals
  `baseline.stream_text` from `/tmp/baseline_eou_stream.gguf` (NeMo streaming).
  Skips (exit 77) unless `PARAKEET_TEST_GGUF_EOU` +
  `PARAKEET_TEST_BASELINE_EOU_STREAM` are set.

Reproduce:

```bash
# Streaming reference (NeMo cache-aware streaming encode + decode):
.venv/bin/python scripts/gen_stream_baseline.py \
    --model nvidia/parakeet_realtime_eou_120m-v1 \
    --audio tests/fixtures/speech.wav --output /tmp/baseline_eou_stream.gguf

# CLI streaming:
./build/examples/cli/parakeet-cli transcribe \
    --model /tmp/eou.gguf --input tests/fixtures/speech.wav --stream
# -> [stream] well i don't wish to see it ... like the old portrait
#    [stream:final] well i don't wish to see it ... like the old portrait

# ctest:
PARAKEET_TEST_GGUF_EOU=/tmp/eou.gguf \
PARAKEET_TEST_BASELINE_EOU=/tmp/baseline_eou.gguf \
PARAKEET_TEST_BASELINE_EOU_STREAM=/tmp/baseline_eou_stream.gguf \
ctest --test-dir build -R "test_capi_stream|test_streaming" --output-on-failure
```

## Timestamps + confidence (vs NeMo `transcribe(timestamps=True)`, `max_prob`)

Per-token and per-word **timestamps** and **confidence** match NeMo's
`transcribe(timestamps=True, return_hypotheses=True)` with the decoding config's
confidence method set to `max_prob` (the rescaled `(N·p_max − 1)/(N − 1)` form,
α = 1.0, over the same logit slice NeMo log-softmaxes; N = vocab + 1 incl. blank).
Validated on `tests/fixtures/speech.wav` + `nvidia/parakeet-tdt_ctc-110m` for
**both** the TDT and CTC heads, against `/tmp/baseline_ts.gguf` (dumped by
`scripts/gen_nemo_baseline.py`).

| Quantity | TDT head | CTC head | Tolerance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| per-token id / frame | exact | exact | exact |
| per-token confidence | ≤5e-6 | ≤5e-6 | < 1e-3 |
| word text (all 23 words) | exact | exact | exact |
| word start / end | **0.0 s** diff | **0.0 s** diff | ≤ frame_sec (1 frame) |
| word confidence (`min` aggregate) | ≤5e-6 | ≤5e-6 | < 1e-3 |

`frame_sec = hop_length × subsampling_factor / sample_rate = 0.08 s/frame` here.
Word start = `first_token.frame × frame_sec`; word end =
`(last_token.frame + span) × frame_sec` (TDT span = predicted duration; CTC span =
the next collapsed token's start − this token's start, i.e. NeMo's run-length
end-offset). Words are grouped on the SentencePiece `▁` (U+2581) word-start
marker with NeMo's punctuation-attachment + `_refine_timestamps` rules
(`pk::group_words`, `src/transcription.cpp`).

### Surfaces

- **`pk::Model::transcribe_with_timestamps` / `transcribe_path_with_timestamps`**
  → `pk::Transcription{text, words[], tokens[]}`.
- **C-API** `parakeet_capi_transcribe_path_json(ctx, wav, decoder)` → malloc'd
  JSON `{"text":..,"words":[{"w","start","end","conf"}],"tokens":[{"id","t","conf"}]}`
  (times %.3f s, conf %.4f; no-throw boundary; freed by
  `parakeet_capi_free_string`; exported from `libparakeet.so`, verified via
  `nm -D`).
- **CLI** `parakeet-cli transcribe --timestamps` (one `<start>-<end>  <word>
  (<conf>)` line per word) and `--json` (the JSON above).
- **Streaming** `pk::StreamingSession::drain_words()` surfaces finalized
  `pk::Word`s as they complete (alongside `drain_events()`); the CLI
  `--stream --timestamps` prints per-word times as words finalize.

### Regression test

- `tests/test_timestamps.cpp` (`test_timestamps`) — token + word
  timestamps/confidence vs NeMo for both heads (`PARAKEET_TEST_GGUF` +
  `PARAKEET_TEST_BASELINE_TS`).
- `tests/test_capi_timestamps.cpp` (`test_capi_timestamps`) — the C-API JSON:
  `"text"` == the NeMo TDT transcript, 23 words, `words[0]` == `Well,` with
  start ≈ 0.48 s and a non-empty `"tokens"` array. Skips (77) unless
  `PARAKEET_TEST_GGUF` is set.

Reproduce:

```bash
# NeMo timestamp + max_prob confidence baseline:
.venv/bin/python scripts/gen_nemo_baseline.py   # -> /tmp/baseline_ts.gguf (see script)

# CLI:
